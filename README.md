# Replication of Turner and Blagg, "Short-Term Effects of the Kansas Income Tax Cuts on Employment Growth"
## Purpose
This repository holds my code and final paper for Econometrics and Policy Research II as part of my graduate studies at GWU.
In it, I attempt to replicate the findings of a 2017 study originally published in *Public Finance Review* by
Tracy M. Turner and Brandon Blagg on "The Short-Term Effects of the Kansas Income Tax Cuts on Employment Growth." 
The original study can be found here: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1091142117699274

## Contents
* Final Paper 
* DD = My replication of the authors' difference in difference analysis. 
* Matching = My replication of the authors' border-county matching analysis.
* Extension = My extensions of the author's difference in difference framework, applying it to a few measures of public expenditure

## Conclusion 
My replication of Turner and Blagg’s study of the effect of Kansas’ tax cuts on short term employment generally 
fails to replicate the authors’ findings. Still, low levels of statistical significance across both of our analyses 
lead us to similar conclusions that restricting the state tax base had a negligible impact in increasing employment 
in both the difference in difference and border-county matching samples. Moreover, my extension of the 
author’s difference in difference model finds that at least in the short term, the policy did have an 
impact on changing state expenditure patterns.
